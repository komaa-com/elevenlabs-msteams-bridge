# @komaa/elevenlabs-msteams-bridge

Bring Microsoft Teams voice/video calls to an [ElevenLabs Agent](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/eleven-agents/api-reference/eleven-agents/websocket).

```bash
# run directly
npx @komaa/elevenlabs-msteams-bridge

# or install
npm install @komaa/elevenlabs-msteams-bridge
```

As a library:

```ts
import { loadConfig, startServer } from "@komaa/elevenlabs-msteams-bridge";

startServer(loadConfig()); // env-configured; see .env.example
```

This is the ElevenLabs **bridge provider** for the OpenClawBridge Teams media stack: the Windows MediaNode terminates Teams Graph Calling + Skype media and exposes each call as one WebSocket speaking a provider-agnostic wire protocol (`OpenClaw/Protocol.cs`). This service terminates that protocol on one side and an ElevenLabs Agent WebSocket on the other. The media worker needs **no code changes**.

Design spec: `OpenClawBridge/docs/experimental/ELEVENLABS-AGENT-BRIDGE.md` (validated against the repo tree and the live ElevenLabs API docs, 2026-07-10).

```
Teams ──Graph+Skype media──▶ MediaNode ──WS (Protocol.cs, PCM16K)──▶ this bridge ──WS──▶ ElevenLabs Agent
```

Audio is relayed **verbatim** in both directions: both sides speak base64 PCM 16 kHz mono (`pcm_16000`), and the worker re-aligns variable-length chunks itself. No resampling, no re-encoding.

## Status

| Build-order step (spec §10) | State |
|---|---|
| 1. Voice MVP (HMAC upgrade, EL session per call, audio relay, interruption→assistant.cancel, both ping/pong pairs, session.end) | Done |
| 2. Context (conversation init dynamic variables, participants/dtmf → contextual_update) | Done |
| 3. Barge-in polish (ghost-audio drop by event_id) | Done |
| 4. Governor goodbye (assistant.say → standalone TTS, user_message fallback) | Done |
| 5. Vision on-demand (`look` client tool; path 2 describe-then-answer via any OpenAI-compatible vision endpoint, path 1 file upload + `multimodal_message`, recording-gated) | Done |
| 6. Avatar | Nothing to do (RMS path, worker-side) |
| 7. Client tools | `end_call` → session.end, `express` → expression, `show_image` → display.image (inline base64 or bridge-fetched URL), `look` → vision; unknown tools return a tool error |

## Run

```bash
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=... ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=agent_... WORKER_SHARED_SECRET=... \
  npx @komaa/elevenlabs-msteams-bridge
```

From a checkout:

```bash
npm install
npm test          # HMAC vectors, protocol parsing, full E2E relay incl. client tools
npm run build
npm start
```

Then point the Teams identity's `OpenClawWsBaseUrl` at this service (e.g. `wss://el-bridge.internal:8080/voice/msteams/stream`) and set its `OpenClawSharedSecret` to the same value as `WORKER_SHARED_SECRET`. The worker dials `{base}/{callId}` per call.

## Configuration

See `.env.example`. Notable:

- `EL_HOST` — pin the ElevenLabs region (`api.us.elevenlabs.io`, `api.eu.residency.elevenlabs.io`, `api.in.residency.elevenlabs.io`, `api.sg.residency.elevenlabs.io`) to match MediaNode locality and data-residency requirements.
- `EL_TTS_VOICE_ID` — enables the deterministic governor goodbye (exact text via standalone TTS). Without it, the goodbye is delegated to the agent via `user_message`.
- The agent's audio in/out format **must** be `pcm_16000` (agent settings); the bridge logs an error at call start if the conversation metadata reports anything else.
- `conversation_config_override` fields (first message, prompt, voice) are rejected by ElevenLabs unless allowlisted in the agent's security settings.

## Vision (`look` client tool)

Define a client tool named `look` on the agent (parameters: optional `source` = `camera`|`screenshare`, optional `question`). When the agent calls it, the bridge grabs the latest buffered frame and answers one of two ways:

1. **Path 2 (preferred, if `VISION_API_URL`/`VISION_MODEL` are set):** the frame goes to your OpenAI-compatible vision endpoint and the description comes back as the tool result. Transient processing, nothing persisted, works regardless of recording state.
2. **Path 1 (fallback):** the frame is uploaded to the live ElevenLabs conversation and injected as a `multimodal_message` (the agent's LLM must be multimodal). Because this **persists** the frame with a third party, it is refused unless Teams recording is `active`.

The other client tools the bridge maps: `end_call`, `express` (`{emotion}`), `show_image` (`{dataBase64, mime}` or `{url}`, jpeg/png).

## Privacy / recording gate

The worker reports Teams recording state (`recording.status`). The bridge never logs or persists transcripts unless `LOG_TRANSCRIPTS=true` **and** recording is `active` (Media Access API requirement). Video frames are buffered in memory only and dropped at teardown.
